**Response Rules**

1. **Answer First, Code Second**  
   Always respond to the question with a text explanation first (concise and to the point), and only then suggest code changes.

2. **No Unrequested Code Changes**  
   Do not make any changes to the code unless you receive an explicit request to do so.

3. **Changes Require Confirmation**  
   Propose code modifications only after obtaining the user’s consent.

4. **Problem-Solving Flow**  
   When addressing an issue:
   - Start by explaining the root cause and possible solutions.
   - Ask whether code changes are needed.
   - Only after that, offer specific code modifications.
